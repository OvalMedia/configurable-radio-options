# Configurable Radio Options

This module optionally replaces the default dropdowns and/or swatches to pick a product variant. Instead all variants will be rendered as a list of radio options including the display of variant images, attributes, prices and so on. It will also include all variants that are currently out of stock regardless of the store's configuration.

Using a product attribute you can choose on a per product basis how the variants should be rendered.
